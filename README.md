## Description
### Camera App built in C, JPEG Encodnig and Processing from scratch. 
JPEGs are no fun now I know.

- 9 Filters, I guess. 

- Custom JPEG Processing.

Drop random frames and pretend it was intentional. 

## Dependencies

You will need to install the SDL2 development library. On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

## Building

```bash
./build.sh
```


## Running

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Controls

- **N**: Cycle through the available filters.
- **Space**: Save the current frame as a JPEG image in the root directory (e.g., `picture-1672108988.jpeg`).
- **Close Window**: Quit the application.
